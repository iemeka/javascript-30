    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    // age = 200
    // console.log(age, age2); //200 , 100

    // let name2 = name;

    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Zod'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // console.log(players, team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.splice();
   

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "Hey now brown cow"
    // console.log(team4, players); 

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[3] = 'cool';
    // console.log(players, team5)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age:12})
    // console.log(person, cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name:'wes',
      age:100,
      social:{
        twitter:'@wesbos',
        facebook:'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    dev.name = "wesly"
    // console.log(dev, wes);

    // assign only copies one level deep, other levels are not copies but references
    // dev.social.twitter = "@coolman";
    // console.log(dev, wes);

    // poor man's deep clone - NOT recommended
    // stringify then back to an object (newly constructed copy) - parsing
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
    dev2.social.twitter = "@coolman";
    console.log(dev2, wes);
